%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.
\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%
\begin{abstract}
\input{parts/abstract.tex}
\end{abstract}

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
\begin{IEEEkeywords}
kNN, MapReduce, Performance Evaluation
\end{IEEEkeywords}}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
% papers do!
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc under a non-conference mode.


% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
% \fi
%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
%for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%IEEEtran.cls version 1.8a and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
%I wish you the best of success.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix

% starts a section numbered zero.)
