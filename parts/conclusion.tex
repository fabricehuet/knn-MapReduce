\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have studied the existing systems to perform the kNN operation in the context of MapReduce. 
We have first approached this problem from a workflow 
point of view. We have pointed out that all solutions follow three main steps to compute kNN over MapReduce, namely the pre-processing of data,
the partitioning and the actual computation. We have listed and explained the different algorithms which could be chosen 
for each step, and developed their pros and cons.
In a second stage, we have further analyzed existing systems by reviewing their main properties, in terms of load balancing, accuracy of the computation, 
and overall complexity. Above all, this paper can be seen as a guideline to help selecting 
the most appropriate method to perform the kNN join operation on MapReduce for a particular use case.
