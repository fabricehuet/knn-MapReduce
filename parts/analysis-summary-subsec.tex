\subsection{Wrap up}
Although the workflow for computing kNN on MapReduce is the same for all existing solutions, the guarantees offered by each of them vary a lot. As load 
balancing is a key point to shrink completion time, one should carefully choose the partitioning method to achieve this goal. Also, the accuracy of the 
computing system is crucial: are exact results really needed? If not, then one might trade accuracy for efficiency, by using data transformation 
techniques before the actual computation. 
Complexity of the global system should also be taken into account for particular needs, although it is often related to the accuracy: an exact system is 
usually more complex than an approximate one.
Finally, none of the systems really offers a way to handle data updates. This is due to the specific partitioning performed before computing. Indeed, an 
efficient partitioning is adapted to a particular dataset, and might not be adapted to another.
Table~\ref{summary_table} is a summary table of the systems we have examined and their main characteristics.
